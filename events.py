"""The Observer pattern, written by hand.

Whoever changes something says so, and whoever shows it is told. The two do
not know each other: the dialog that saves a template does not know that the
list of templates is open, and it does not need to. It says "templates", and
every window that asked to be told reloads.

    events.subscribe("templates", self.on_templates)    # when a window opens
    events.notify("templates", template_id)             # when a row is saved
    events.unsubscribe("templates", self.on_templates)  # when it closes

notify is synchronous: the callbacks run before it returns. A window that
reads its own dictionaries after calling notify may find them already
cleared by a callback, so whatever is needed goes into a variable first.
