"""The application log, written by hand.

The standard library has `logging`, which does this and much more: levels,
handlers, formats. This class does only what pittacium needs, so that a
reader can see what a logger does underneath: take the time, find out who
is calling, append one entry to a file, and move the file aside when it is
full.

Every attempt to print is written down, the ones that work too, and a
label that did not come out is a warning and not an error of the program.

What a label said is never written here (CONVENTIONS.md): that it was
printed, in which format, how many copies and how it went - not its text.

It also keeps the trace: with `python3 pittacium.py --trace`, trace()
prints on the terminal, line by line, what the program is doing and what
its variables hold, while the window is in use.
